# What is a modern browser

According to : [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/tims/a-modern-browser)

* Modern browsers are fast. They take full advantage of the underlying platform to render graphics with the GPU, compile and execute [[JavaScript]] across multiple CPU cores and ensure that web applications run as close as possible to the same speed as native applications.

* Modern browsers enable rich, immersive experiences that could hitherto only be delivered through a plug-in or native application. They can blend video, vector and raster graphics, audio and text seamlessly without sacrificing performance.

* Modern browsers implement features when they are ready, providing predictable patterns that developers can rely on rather than suddenly breaking or removing specifications. They don’t check off support based on a half-completed implementation written to pass a synthetic test, but validate against a test suite that confirms interoperability.

* Modern browsers do adopt standards at an early stage of readiness so developers can experiment and validate the specification, but clearly delineate unstable prototypes as such.

##Web standards

A browser should no only be reliable but also should follow certain standards, thanks to those [[web standards]] modern browsers become consistent and reliable not only to the user but to the people that develops web applications.

Check: [Web Standards](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Archive/Estándares_Web)

## A protocol(s)
The information on the web browser ins transferred via the [[HTTP]] or Hypertext transfer protocol which defines how text, images and video is transmitted over the web. 

Browser fetches data from a [[Internet]] connected server and the uses a piece of software called [[Rendering Engine]] to translate data into text an images. The data is written in [[HTML]] and it’s read by browsers to create the experience.

[[Hyperlinks]] users to follow a path to other pages or sites on the web. Every webpage, image and video has its own unique Uniform Resource Locator (URL), which is also known as a web address. When a browser visits a server for data, the web address tells the browser where to look for each item that is described in the HTML, which then tells the browser where it goes on the web page.

##[[Cookies]]

Websites save information about you in files called [[cookies]]. They are saved on your computer for the next time you visit that site. Upon your return, the website code will read that file to see that it’s you. For example, when you go to a website and the page remembers your username and password – that’s made possible by a cookie.

There are also cookies that remember more detailed information about you. Perhaps your interests, your web browsing patterns, etc. This means that a site can provide you more targeted content – often in the form of ads. There are types of cookies, called third-party cookies, that come from sites you’re not even visiting at the time and can track you from site to site to gather information about you, which is sometimes sold to other companies. Sometimes you can block these kinds of cookies, though not all browsers allow you to.
