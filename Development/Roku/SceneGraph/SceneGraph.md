The SceneGraph framework is used for developing channels. This framework incorporates two key concepts:

SceneGraph rendering of the channel screens
[[SceneGraph XML]] configuration of the [[SceneGraph screens]].

The goal of this programming framework is to speed channel development time by reducing the amount of procedural code that must be written to render a screen display. Instead, the appearance of the screen can be configured as screen component attributes set in [[SceneGraph XML]] files. Much of the appearance and behavior of screen components has been coded into the SceneGraph components that Roku provides, allowing you to quickly select and set the attributes of each component to match the design of your channel, and allowing easier development of more complex screen displays than were possible in previous Roku firmware.

In addition, the [[SceneGraph XML]] programming framework includes a new capability to design your channel's user interface for specific screen display resolutions, but also with the flexibility to allow the user interface to render correctly on Roku players that do not support the intended display resolution.
