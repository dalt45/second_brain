| Attribute                | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Sample manifest entry           |
| ------------------------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `supports_input_launch`  | integer | The [roInputEvent](/docs/references/brightscript/events/roinputevent.md) is used to check whether a deep link has been passed into the application while your channel is running. This enables your application to deep link into content without re-launching your channel. This attribute must be added to the channel manifest for this functionality to work. | `supports_input_launch=1`       |
| `requires_audiometadata` | integer | The [roAudioMetadata](/docs/references/brightscript/components/roaudiometadata.md) component requires the use of a dynamically loaded library that is not part of the initially booted image. Therefore, an entry must be added to the manifest of any applications that use the roAudioMetadata component so that it can be loaded when the channel is launched. | `requires_audiometadata=1`      |
| `requires_gaming_remote` | integer | Specifies that a gaming remote must be linked to the Roku Player to launch the application. If not, a dialog box is presented to the user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | `requires_gaming_remote=1`      |
| `requires_mkv`           | integer | Playing MKV files requires the use of a dynamically loaded library that is not part of the initially booted image. Therefore, an entry must be added to the manifest of any applications that require MKV support so that support is enabled when the channel is launched.                                                                                        | `requires_mkv=1`                |
| `network_not_required`   | integer | Set to 1 to specify the application does not require the network (such as the USB Media Player). This lets the user launch an application even if there is no network connection.                                                                                                                                                                                 | `network_not_required=1`        |
| `bs_libs_required`       | string  | Specifies the BrightScript libraries required for the application.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | `bs_libs_required=roku_ads_lib` |
| `usb_media_handler`      | integer | Set to 1 to specify if the channel can be auto-launched when a USB device is inserted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | `usb_media_handler=1`           |
